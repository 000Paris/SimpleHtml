	  My goals in life are to study hard, be my dream job, start business and give my family a better life.
	       I also have a inspirational qoute and I would like to share it â€œTrust yourself that you can do it" 
this quote is by Baz Luhrmann. I always relay my life to this qoute, this means eve how hard life is I would still
 fight, even if a lot of works to do I will accomplish it and even there is the time you wanted to give up just talk to go, "you can do it"
